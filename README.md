This is a project was a personal assignment second year CS course of UOttawa, CSI 2110
The purpose of this program is to 
In this programming assignment, you will implement a data clustering algorithm named DBSCAN -
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. Given a large set of data points in a space
of arbitrary dimension and given a distance metric, this algorithm can discover clusters of different
shapes and sizes, marking as outliers isolated points in low-density regions (i.e. points whose nearest
neighbors are too far away).
